🌟 Leveraging cutting edge technologies, including Django, ReactJS, NodeJs, Vite, React Native, WebMapping, Leaflet and DeckGL, I developed an innovative solution to enhance road safety and predict accident prone areas using ConvLSTM algorithms.

🔍 Watch the video to see how our app analyzes traffic data, identifies patterns, and makes predictions with amazing accuracy. By identifying potential accident sites, we are taking a proactive approach to making the streets of London safer for everyone.

📱 The mobile app, built with React Native, empowers members must write down and record any new traffic accident. Thus, we enable the algorithm to process using recent data.

💡 Interestingly, the inception of this project draws inspiration from IBM's venture in the USA, where a similar concept was employed to tackle criminality. We're pioneering a novel approach, adapting it to the critical domain of road safety and accident prevention.

🌐 We are proud to contribute to the safety of cities and apply artificial intelligence for the greater good. Exciting times for technology and road safety!
